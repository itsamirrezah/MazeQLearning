# Maze Q-Learning

** Q-Learning**
Q-learning is an off policy reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It's considered off-policy because the q-learning function learns from actions that are outside the current policy, like taking random actions, and therefore a policy isn?t needed. More specifically, q-learning seeks to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward.
